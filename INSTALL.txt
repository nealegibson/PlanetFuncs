PlanetFuncs python module - simple collection of python functions, most usefully including functions to compute exoplanet transit light curves (quadratic and nonlinear). This is
forked from MyFuncs.

------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

This module first needs the GSL scientific C library installed.

The simple version is to install via conda
$ conda install gsl

Then the module can be installed as normal
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install
or
$ python setup.py install --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR>

------------------------------------------

Alternatively you can install GSL from source, and make sure it's available on your CPATH and LIBRARY_PATH. It's quite easy, in principle could speed up the code if it's better tuned to your machine.

You can either download the latest version of GSL from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ or use one of the versions included in this distribution.

It is easy to install, just download, unpack, enter directory:
$ tar -xzvf gsl-1.16.tar.gz
$ cd gsl-1.16

Then run configure
$ ./configure
or first configure to a different directory? - see gsl install instructions
$ ./configure --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR>
or for your home directory
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME

Then need to build and install with make
$ make
$ make install

Finally, to complete the installation your C compilers need to know where to look for the headers and code. Depending on the path, they may already be automatically found. If in doubt, you'll need to add to your CPATH and LIBRARY_PATH:
e.g. in bash:
$ export CPATH="${HOME}/include:$CPATH"
$ export LIBRARY_PATH="${HOME}/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"
or for a non-standard location:
$ export CPATH="<INSTALL_DIR>/include:$CPATH"
$ export LIBRARY_PATH="<INSTALL_DIR>/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"

Then you can run python setup.py install as above.
